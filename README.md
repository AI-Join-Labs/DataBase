# Fun Guide to Create a Relational Database!

Hello, data adventurer! 🌟 You're about to embark on an exciting journey to build a relational database. Throughout this guide, We'll walk you through each exercise in a fun and engaging way. Let’s get started!

## 🚀 Phase 1: Business Analysis
### 1. Identify the Business

First, choose your world: will it be an online store, a magical library, or an adventure hotel? 🏪📚🏨

### 2. Characteristics and Needs
Make a list of the tables you’ll need. Think of it like inventorying your characters! For example:
<ul>
  <li>Patients</li>
  <li>Doctors</li>
  <li>Medical History</li>
  <li>Appointments</li>
  <li>Drugs</li>
  <li>Medical Treatments</li>
  <li>Treatments & Drugs</li>
</ul>

### 3. Data Types and Relationships
Define what type of data each table will hold. Imagine each table as a group of friends! A hospital can have many patients. Relationships are key! ❤️

### 4. Schema Draft
Sketch a draft of your schema on paper or use a tool like Excalidraw. Make it as colorful as you like!

### 2. Minimum Entities
Define your tables and data types. Think of them as characters in your story, each with their roles and characteristics.

### 3. Relationships

Specify primary and foreign keys. Remember: each character needs to know who their friends are. Let’s make those connections!

## ⚙️ Phase 3: Creating the Database and Relationships
### 1. Create the Database

Here comes the fun part! Create the tables in your database and define the primary keys. 🛠️
### 2. Define Relationships

Use foreign keys to link related tables. Connections are essential in the data world!

## 🎉 Phase 4: Data Insertion
### 1. Data Generation

Get help from ChatGPT to generate at least 20 records per table. It’s like filling your story with unique characters! 🤖

### 2. Insert Data

Now it’s time to add those records to your MySQL database! Use SQL commands to insert the data. Celebrate each insertion! 🎊

### 1. Basic Queries

Perform two simple queries. It’s like asking a friend what’s in the fridge! 🍕

### 2. Filtering and Aggregation

Run at least 4 queries applying filters and aggregation functions. Each query will be a different adventure! Use COUNT, SUM, AVG, MAX, and MIN to gather valuable insights.

### 3. Sorting and Joins

Execute at least 4 queries that sort results and join tables. It’s like gathering all your characters for a big party! Make sure to use each type of JOIN (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL).

## 🎉 Congratulations!
